# Activation-Function-in-Neural-Networks

It is used to determine the output of neural network. The Activation Functions can be basically divided into 2 types-
A). Linear Activation Function, B). Non-linear Activation Functions

The Nonlinear Activation Functions are mainly divided on the basis of their range or curves:-

# 1. Sigmoid 

It is especially used for models where we have to predict the probability as an output.Since probability of anything exists only between the range of 0 and 1, sigmoid is the right choice.
The Sigmoid Function curve looks like a S-shape.

The function is differentiable.That means, we can find the slope of the sigmoid curve at any two points.
